# Play Fetch Challenge

## Challenge Overview:
In this project, I used my skills with arrays and random number generation to create a game where balls randomly fall from the sky. The goal was to program a dog to catch these balls before they hit the ground. I focused on proper variable assignment, crafting effective if-statements, ensuring accurate collision detection, and generating objects randomly.

## Challenge Outcome:

* I programmed a system to generate a random ball (out of 3 types) at a random x position above the screen.
* When the user presses the spacebar, I made sure a dog is spawned and moves to catch the ball.
* If the dog collides with the ball, the ball is destroyed.
* If the ball hits the ground, I implemented a “Game Over” debug message.
* I ensured that balls and dogs are removed from the scene when they leave the screen.
