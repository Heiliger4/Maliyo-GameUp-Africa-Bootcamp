# Endless Runner Game

## About the Project
This **Endless Runner Game** is a Unity-based 3D endless runner inspired by N3ks' tutorial on creating infinite runners. While the project is based on the tutorial, it has been modified significantly using free Unity game assets to create a unique experience. Please note that the project is currently incomplete, particularly in terms of UI elements and overall polish. This project serves as part of the Maliyo Game Week 8 assignment.

## Objectives
- **Learn from Tutorials**: Utilize the N3ks tutorial as a foundation for understanding endless runner mechanics.
- **Modify and Customize**: Adapt the tutorial project with new features and assets to create a distinct version of the game.
- **Implement Procedural Generation**: Design a dynamic environment for infinite gameplay.
- **Add an In-Game Shop**: Integrate a shop for power-ups and item purchases.
- **Incorporate Third-Party Services**: Add Google Play Games for leaderboards and achievements, and Unity Ads for monetization.

## Features
- **Procedurally Generated Worlds**: Creates endless, unique environments.
- **In-Game Shop**: Allows players to buy power-ups and items for the running character.
- **Google Play Games Integration**: Includes leaderboards and achievements to boost player engagement.
- **Unity Ads Integration**: Adds ad-based revenue potential for longevity and monetization.
- **Unity Free Assets**: Utilizes available assets from the Unity Asset Store to enhance the visual appeal of the game.

## Current Status
- The project is still a work in progress, especially regarding UI elements. Future updates will focus on refining the user interface and improving overall gameplay experience.
